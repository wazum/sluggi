# Temporary redirects with automatic expiration
#
# Uses 307 (Temporary Redirect) with a 90-day TTL. Useful when URLs change
# frequently (e.g. news, events, campaigns) and you don't want old redirects
# piling up forever. Search engines keep indexing the new URL while old links
# still work for 90 days.
#
# Import in config/sites/<your-site>/settings.yaml:
#   imports:
#     - { resource: 'EXT:sluggi/Configuration/SiteSettings/temporary-with-ttl.settings.yaml' }
