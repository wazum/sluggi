# Child slug updates only, no automatic redirects
#
# Child pages still update recursively when a parent slug changes, but no
# redirect records are created. Use this if you manage redirects externally
# (e.g. in a reverse proxy or CDN) or if your editors handle redirects
# manually through the TYPO3 Redirects backend module.
#
# When sluggi's "redirect_control" feature is enabled, editors will not see
# the redirect creation modal since auto-creation is disabled entirely.
#
# Import in config/sites/<your-site>/settings.yaml:
#   imports:
#     - { resource: 'EXT:sluggi/Configuration/SiteSettings/no-auto-redirects.settings.yaml' }
